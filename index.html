    <h2>Wed Aug 11 22:11:11 PDT 2021</h2>

    <br /><b>Layers graph</b> represents historical precipitation events for stations during the last week.
    Discrete events are separated by <font color="#daa520>">goldenrod</font> lines.
    Events separated by <font color="red">red</font> lines are older than 3 days.
    Each event consists of three sub-bars representing temperatures at the start, middle and end of precipitation event.
    Blues are temperatures below freezing with darker shades representing colder temperatures.
    Greens are temperatures above freezing with the darker shades being warmer temperatures.
    Hovering over a bar shows some extra information about the event.
    Clicking on a bar will open historical graphs from NWAC.
    Freezing level is merely an approximation by extrapolation.
    Events which are still in progress will have <i>NaT</i> in <i>To</i> rubrick.<br />

    <br /><b>Precipitation events graph</b> is a scatter plot of precipitation events during the week.
    Temperature is represented on x-axis, while cummulative amount on y-axis (size of bubbles also indicates the amount of precipitation).
    Bubbles are positioned on x-axis based on average temperature during event and lines extending to the sides show temperature extremes.
    Color of the bubble represents how much time has passed since the end of event, with lighter shades being older events.
    Hovering over a bar shows some extra information about the event.
    Events which are still in progress will have <i>NaT</i> in <i>To</i> rubrick.<br />
